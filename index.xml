Additionally, you can have your self-hosted instance perform automated, encrypted backups to Homechart Cloud. Visit /subscription on your self-hosted instance to enable this.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/updates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/updates/</guid><description>Updates # Homechart is easily updated by replacing the container or executable with a newer version.
Binary Updates # To update your Homechart binary, download a new copy of homechart_latest. You can compare the SHA-512 sum of your existing executable to see if you need to update.
