Self hosted Homechart is easy to backup: all persistent data is stored in PostgreSQL, Homechart doesn&amp;rsquo;t save anything locally. You can use tools like pg_dump or wal-g to perform the backup. Optionally, you can subscribe to Homechart Premium for automated, encrypted backups stored in an offsite location.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/updates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/updates/</guid><description>Updates # Homechart is easily updated by replacing the container or executable with a newer version.
Binary Updates # To update your Homechart binary, download a new copy of homechart_latest. You can compare the SHA-512 sum of your existing executable to see if you need to update.
Container Updates # To update your Homechart container, pull the latest container, e.g.:
docker pull candiddev/homechart:latest
Depending on how you&amp;rsquo;re running Homechart, you may need to remove the existing Homechart container or re-run docker-compose up</description></item><item><title>Single Sign-On (SSO)</title><link>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/sso/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.homechart.app/getting-started/on-your-network/operations/sso/</guid><description>Single Sign-On (SSO) # For self-hosted users, Homechart can integrate with your existing authentication system to allow your household members to authenticate with it or even sign in automatically. Some things to note:
The account will be created if the email address does not exist in Homechart already. You should pre-create your household members using the email address that the SSO will pass through, otherwise they will be created under a separate household.</description></item></channel></rss>
